<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>


<p><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 100%">I</span> <span style="text-transform: uppercase">am</span> fully aware of the fact that the present volume
is but an intrusion at the best; however, I trust
my readers will be pleased to overlook the many
faults of a bagatelle as insignificant and pitiable as its
author.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have introduced the first
canto of Midsummer Idylls in a revised form, and it
has been my especial care to correct, as far as it was
consistent with the meaning of the passage, any hitch
in the Iambic Measure which might offend the ear. An
author has himself to please as well as his public, and
it has been to me a matter of much study that the
Iambics should be as pure, or at least as tolerable, as
circumstances would allow, though, while I can ill permit
an irregular or inharmonious line, I hope I may not be
found guilty of sacrificing sense to sound. I beg to
tender those my most cordial thanks who have dealt
indulgently with my rhymes hitherto, and to acknowledge,
with profound gratitude, the kind encouragement
of those great men of letters who have condescended to
notice so small a bard. The opinions of the Metropolitan,
Provincial, and Foreign Press could not have
been other than gratifying to me, and it is with a humble
hope of favour that I submit the following pages to a
discerning public.

<span class="i0">Oh say thou wilt not turn away, oh say we must not part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou would'st not spurn this aching breast, nor crush this breaking heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without thee, what is Life?&mdash;a name&mdash;in which no life can be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh give me back thy smile, thy tear&mdash;'tis all the world to me.<br /></span>
